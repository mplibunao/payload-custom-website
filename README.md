# TODO

## SEO

- Use seo plugin to be able to derive title and description from specific fields
- Make description optional

## Error pages

- Add error pages

## Studies

- Rename to case studies
- Move main case studies page to use pages
- Add `case-studies` in links relation so we can link from main case studies page to `case-studies/$slug`
- Refactor SiteLink to include new relations

## Google analytics

- Use homu as reference
- Look into preconnect link

## Sitemap and robots.txt

- See epic stack for implementation

## See if you can convert switch components to React.lazy

- Can you do nested suspense?
